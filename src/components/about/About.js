                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p> I grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, before heading to the East Coast to go to Yale. I walked on to the Women's Varsity Crew Team and majored in Computer Science and Math.
                      After four years of problem sets and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_rower">erg</a> tests, I moved from Connecticut to New York, and have since spent most of my professional career in New York City. 
                      From Pet Care, to Finance, to Fitness, I've been in various different fields and roles to date, gaining experience in software development, devops, markets, finance, operations, project manangement, and business development.  
                      Outisde of work, I enjoy running and all other forms of exercise, and I've completed multiple marathons and one IRONMAN 70.3 race to date. I'm currently loving road cycling and racing, and I'm training for a full IRONMAN in May 2022.
                      When I'm not working out, I'm usually hanging out with my dog, Oberon.
